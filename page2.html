<p style="font-family:Verdana">Rast Spinoff #2: 0%</p>

<p style="font-family:Verdana">These are not live updates!</p>

<p style="font-family:Verdana">News:</p>

<p style="font-family:Verdana">I now have a Spotify account for music! You can find it on the home page, or in the music section. Now you Spotify premium flexers can flex even more because you can listen to NOW THATS WHAT I CALL DRY or any other songs I have made on Spotify!</p>

<p style="font-family:Verdana">UPDATE: I feel even more sick. I might not work on videos for a couple days and I might not be in school. Don't worry, videos aren't cancelled or anything like that. Just don't expect videos to come out soon.</p>

<p style="font-family:Verdana">Marnoc Tak 3 is happening! I'm a bit sick sadly, so I won't be working on it right now, and also we have tests at school, but it has been officially announced! It might take a couple months again, but hopefully not. I might make a different version (well not really) where it is split up into parts for school use, as this will be the longest Marnoc Tak yet. I am also happy to say that Potatato 2 is being worked on as well.</p>

<p style="font-family:Verdana">I am an owner of a new channel, WIACU Inc. This channel will have the WIA series (Who is albert) which is based off of true events. I'm currently not working on it because of me being sick and school right now, however once I am better I will start working on it. (The same applys with Marnoc Tak 3, Rast 3 YT etc.) The Dry Losers is still my main project, so I will work on that more than WIA for sure. </p>
